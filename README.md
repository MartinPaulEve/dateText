Takes a file called infile.txt and produces an output file, dated_outfile.csv, that contains a list of dates for each word in infile.txt.

The program expects there to be one word per line in infile.txt.

Anticipated usage is for verifying linguistic accuracy of language used in historical fiction/parody.

At the moment, this tool searches for usages on dictionary.com that specify a date range (e.g. 1900-1905) and single dates (900, "before 900") etc.
